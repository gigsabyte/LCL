Long ago, there came a traveler
who told us of place 
where light filled the world.
h
We have never known such a thing.
h
We are creatures of the dark.
For us, light is our dying gift.
h
Right click to sacrifice.

Tempted by the traveler's tale,
we built a great ship, 
fueled by the memories of our loved ones.
h
It disappeared into the dark, 
a trail of torches left along its path.
h
It must have failed.
The torches died out, and 
the ship was lost to the depths.
h
But we can't let that be end...
h
We must find it.
We must not let this be in vain.
h
If we just follow the light...
