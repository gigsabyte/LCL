long ago, there came a traveler
who told us of place 
where light filled the world.

h
we have never known such a thing.

h
we are creatures of the dark.
for us, light is our dying gift.

h
right click to sacrifice.

h
tempted by the traveler's tale,
we built a great ship, 
fueled by the memories of our loved ones.

h
tt disappeared into the dark, 
a trail of torches left along its path.

h
it must have failed.
the torches died out, and 
the ship was lost to the depths.

h
But we can't let that be end...

h
we must find it.
we must not let this be in vain.
h
if we just follow the light...
