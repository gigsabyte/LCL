We are told we cannot leave this place. 
We have neither ability nor reason.

We are told to live in the dark, 
unquestioning and complacent.

And yet...

Left click to move.

Long ago, there was one 
who dared to escape. 

A great ship was built, and 
the bodies of the fallen fueled it.
h
It disappeared into the dark, 
a trail of torches left along its path.
h
It failed.
The torches no longer burn, and 
the ship has been lost to the depths.
h
We are creatures of the dark, 
but in our last moments, 
we can show light to others.
h



Right click to sacrifice.
h
If we use this power, 
we can find the ship. 
h
We can escape...
